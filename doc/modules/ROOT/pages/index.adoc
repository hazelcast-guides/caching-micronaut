= Getting Started with Hazelcast using Micronaut

This guide will get you started to use Hazelcast in a Micronaut application.

== Prerequisites

- ~15 minutes
- Apache Maven 3.2+
- JDK 11+

== The Micronaut Application Structure

The application in the initial directory is a basic Micronaut app having three endpoints:

-   `/` is the homepage returning “Homepage” string only
-   `/put` is the mapping where key and value are saved to a local map through `@CachePut` annotation.
-   `/get` is the mapping where the values in the local map can be obtained by keys through `@Cacheable` annotation.


== Using Hazelcast in the Application

To configure caching with Hazelcast, we'll start by adding some dependencies to our `pom.xml` file:
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.micronaut.cache</groupId>
    <artifactId>micronaut-cache-hazelcast</artifactId>
    <version>${micronaut-cache-hazelcast.version}</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.hazelcast</groupId>
    <artifactId>hazelcast</artifactId>
    <version>${hazelcast.version}</version>
</dependency>
----
The first dependency is Micronaut Cache for Hazelcast, the second one is Hazelcast IMDG itself.

Now, we just need to add a configuration bean to enable Hazelcast:
[source,java]
----
@Factory
public class HazelcastConfiguration {

    @Bean
    public Config hazelcastConfig() {
        Config configuration = new Config()
          .setClusterName("micronaut-cluster");
        JoinConfig joinConfig = configuration.getNetworkConfig().getJoin();
        joinConfig.getMulticastConfig().setEnabled(false);
        joinConfig.getTcpIpConfig().setEnabled(true).addMember("localhost");
        return configuration;
    }
}
----
This allows defining a custom configuration for our Hazelcast instance bean. We enable TCP/IP config for the discovery.


Our application with Hazelcast caching is now ready to go. We don't need to change anything else because we're already using Micronaut caching annotations in the `CommandService` class.


== Running the Sample Application

Build the application by using Maven:

[source,shell]
----
mvn clean package
----

[NOTE]
====
The very first request to each application instance will take a bit longer time to respond since the first request causes the Hazelcast instance to be started.
====

Run the application by typing:
[source,shell]
----
java -jar target/hazelcast-embedded-micronaut-0.1.0.jar 8080
----

Open another terminal and rerun the application by typing
[source,shell]
----
java -jar target/hazelcast-embedded-micronaut-0.1.0.jar 8081
----


//
//After both application instances initialized, you should see the Hazelcast cluster formation in the output similar below:
//[source]
//----
//...
//Members {size:2, ver:2} [
//Member [192.168.1.64]:5701 - 520aec3f-58a6-4fcb-a3c7-498dcf37d8ff
//Member [192.168.1.64]:5702 - 5c03e467-d457-4847-b49a-745a335db557 this
//]
//...
//----


Now, you can issue HTTP calls to read/write data from the cache.

Firstly, open another terminal and run the following command to put the data into a Hazelcast distributed map:
[source,shell]
----
curl  "localhost:8080/put?key=key1&value=hazelcast"
----

You will see the value in the output. Then run the command below to get the data back. Please note we're calling the other application instance:
[source,shell]
----
curl "localhost:8081/get?key=key1"
----

Again, you will see the value in the output since the data is distributed among Hazelcast cluster instances and can be accessed from any of them.

== Summary

In this guide, we developed a simple application that stores the data in a Hazelcast instance. We started two application instances, and they formed a Hazelcast cluster. Since the data was shared among Hazelcast cluster instances, we could access it from both application instances.
